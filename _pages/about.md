Hello! I am now an Applied Scientist in Amazon Search (Palo Alto, US). 

I got a Ph.D. from [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/), University of Michigan, advised by [Prof. VG Vinod Vydiswaran](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~vgvinodv/). I also worked with [Prof. Qiaozhu Mei](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/) between 2015-2020, and [Prof. Daniel M. Romero](http://www.dromero.org/) between 2018-2020.  

Prior to UM, I received my honored bachelor degree in Computer Science from Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University in 2017. During my undergraduate period, I was supervised by [Prof. Fei Wu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=XJLn4MYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).  

I primarily working on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. My recent research focuses on below topics:

* Self-Supervised Representation Learning (contrastive learning). 

* Historical Language Change (such as semantic shift)

* Robustness of ML models (backdoor attack and defense of LLMs).

* Diffusion Models for Non-Autoregressive Generation.

* Knowledge Distillation (from advanced black-box LLM to small models).
