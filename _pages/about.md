Hello! My name is Zhuofeng Wu. I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Information](https://www.si.umich.edu/), University of Michigan, advised by [Prof. VG Vinod Vydiswaran](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~vgvinodv/). I also worked with [Prof. Qiaozhu Mei](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~qmei/) between 2015-2020, and [Prof. Daniel M. Romero](http://www.dromero.org/) between 2018-2020.  

Prior to UM, I received my honored bachelor degree in Computer Science from Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University in 2017. During my undergraduate period, I was supervised by [Prof. Fei Wu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=XJLn4MYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).  

**I am currently actively searching for research positions in the industry, as well as postdoctoral and faculty positions in academia. If you are aware of any openings, I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know. Thank you!**

I primarily working on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. My recent research focuses on below topics:

* Self-Supervised Representation Learning (contrastive learning). 

* Robustness of ML model (backdoor attack and defense of LLM).

* Knowledge Distillation (from advanced black-box LLM to small models).

* Diffusion Models for Non-Autoregressive Generation.
